Changes in version 0.30 - Jan. 12, 2014

1. If you are running a previous copy of this code, you need to modify the json_cache and tweets tables:

   The json_cache table used a field called parsed to record the parsing status of each new tweet. This 
   field started as 0 and was set to 1 when parsed. This field has now been removed. The parse_tweets.php
   script now deletes each row in the json_cache table after it has been parsed. This speeds up insertions,
   since the json_cache table remains very small. You can remove the parsed field from the json_cache table. 

   The parse_tweets.php code now flags retweets with a field called is_rt in the tweets table. You MUST 
   add an is_rt field as a Boolean (tinyint) field in the tweets table, or else the parsing code will
   fail. 
   
   The entities field is no longer recorded with tweets for later use, so you can delete the 
   entities field from the tweets table. This will reduce the size of the tweets table, and thus 
   speed up insertions. The entities field was used in earlier versions to linkify tweet text 
   in the display module. This linkify code has been modified to no longer need entities to create 
   proper links for mentions, tags, and URLs in tweets.

2. The streaming API sometimes fails to deliver a proper id_str property with each tweet to record the
tweet id. This is due to two causes. Deletion notices are in a different format from tweets and the id_str
field is stored in a different object structure from a normal tweet. The API also has an intermittent error
that causes it to drop the id_str value. Both of these issues caused warning notices that end up in the 
error_log.txt file. The get_tweets.php script has been changed in this version to ignore tweets with a 
missing or improperly formed id_str value. 

3. The parse_tweets.php script now deletes rows in the json_cache table as they are being parsed. 

4. The parse_tweets.php script has been modified to handle retweets in two new ways:
   The entities from the original tweet are now used to extract mentions, tags, and URLs. This is a more 
   complete set of data than the entities found in the retweeted version. 
   
   A new is_rt flag is set to 1 for a retweet, and this is stored in the tweets table. 
   
5. The parse_tweets.php script has been modified to only record tweets that have a specific language. This is
done by checking the lang property in each tweet. The distribution code checks for a language value of 'en' 
for English, but you can change this to any language. 

6. One cause of confusion in earlier versions was the need to fill in paths to the code directories in 
140dev_config.php. These path constants have been removed from this file, and the streaming API database code
has been modified to no longer need them. The tweet display plugin still needs the URL for Ajax calls, and 
this should now be entered in the twitter_display_config.php file found in the code for that plugin.
